These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:\n\nThe Leads\nThe Custom Attributes\nThe Leads Lists\nThe Email Sequences\n\t\nAPI endpoint\nhttps://api.hunter.io/v2/\nStructure\n\nOur API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:\n\ndata contains the data you requested.\nmeta provides information regarding your request.\nerrors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.\n\t\nSuccessful response\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"meta\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nError response\n{\n  \"errors\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\nAuthentication\n\nAuthentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In case of error, the API returns an array of errors containing information regarding what happened.\n\n\t\nHTTP Status Code Summary\n200 - OK\tThe request was successful.\n201 - Created\tThe request was successful and the resource was created.\n204 - No content\tThe request was successful and no additional content was sent.\n400 - Bad request\tYour request was not valid. It was missing a required parameter or a supplied parameter was invalid.\n401 - Unauthorized\tNo valid API key was provided.\n403 - Forbidden\tYou have reached the rate limit.\n404 - Not found\tThe requested resource does not exist.\n422 - Unprocessable entity\tYour request is valid but the creation of the resource failed. Check the errors.\n429 - Too many requests\tYou have reached your usage limit.

This call is free.\n\nEach response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.\n\nYou can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.\n\nYou can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.\n\nquery\tSearch query, in your natural language.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response.

Learn more about the errors responses.\n\t\nSuccessful response\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"meta\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nError response\n{\n  \"errors\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\nAuthentication\n\nAuthentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.\n\nIt can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).\n\nYour API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.\n\nA special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.\n\n\t\n\nSign up to get your free API key.\n\nErrors\n\nHunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
