Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

max_duration	The maximum duration of the request in seconds. Setting a longer duration allows us to refine the results and provide more accurate data. It must range between 3 and 20. The default is 10.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

Email Finder

This API endpoint finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.

domain
Required*
	The domain name of the company.
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that providing the domain name gives better results as it removes the conversion from the company name. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, the domain name will be used. The company name doesn't need to be in lowercase.
linkedin_handle
Required*
	The handle of the LinkedIn profile for which you to find the email address.
first_name
Required**
	The person's first name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
last_name
Required**
	The person's last name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
full_name
Required**
	The person's full name. Note that you'll get better results by supplying the person's first and last name if you can. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
max_duration	The maximum duration of the request in seconds. Setting a longer duration allows us to refine the results and provide more accurate data. It must range between 3 and 20. The default is 10.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name, the company name, or the LinkedIn handle.

** You must send at least the first name and the last name or the full name (except if using the LinkedIn handle).

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Europe, Asia, North America, Africa, Antarctica, South America or Oceania

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "headquarters_location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}

industry	The industries you want to select companies by, you can specify a list of industries to include and/or a list to exclude. See industries.json for the list of valid industries.
headcount	The company sizes you want to include in the results. The possible values are 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-10000 or 10001+
company_type	The types of companies you want to select on. You can specify a list of types to include and/or exclude. The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
keywords	Keywords to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of keywords in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all keywords in the match field (the default value is all).
technology	Technologies to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of technologies in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all technologies in the match field (the default value is all). See technologies.json for the list of valid technologies.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
funding	You can provide a list of funding series in the series field to narrow down your selection of companies. The possible values are pre_seed, seed, pre_series_a, series_a, pre_series_b, series_b, pre_series_c, series_c+ or other

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.

Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

Email Finder

This API endpoint finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.

domain
Required*
	The domain name of the company.
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that providing the domain name gives better results as it removes the conversion from the company name. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, the domain name will be used. The company name doesn't need to be in lowercase.
linkedin_handle
Required*
	The handle of the LinkedIn profile for which you to find the email address.
first_name
Required**
	The person's first name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
last_name
Required**
	The person's last name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
full_name
Required**
	The person's full name. Note that you'll get better results by supplying the person's first and last name if you can. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
max_duration	The maximum duration of the request in seconds. Setting a longer duration allows us to refine the results and provide more accurate data. It must range between 3 and 20. The default is 10.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name, the company name, or the LinkedIn handle.

** You must send at least the first name and the last name or the full name (except if using the LinkedIn handle).

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Europe, Asia, North America, Africa, Antarctica, South America or Oceania

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "headquarters_location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}

industry	The industries you want to select companies by, you can specify a list of industries to include and/or a list to exclude. See industries.json for the list of valid industries.
headcount	The company sizes you want to include in the results. The possible values are 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-10000 or 10001+
company_type	The types of companies you want to select on. You can specify a list of types to include and/or exclude. The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
keywords	Keywords to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of keywords in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all keywords in the match field (the default value is all).
technology	Technologies to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of technologies in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all technologies in the match field (the default value is all). See technologies.json for the list of valid technologies.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
funding	You can provide a list of funding series in the series field to narrow down your selection of companies. The possible values are pre_seed, seed, pre_series_a, series_a, pre_series_b, series_b, pre_series_c, series_c+ or other

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Errors

Hunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In case of error, the API returns an array of errors containing information regarding what happened.

	
HTTP Status Code Summary
200 - OK	The request was successful.
201 - Created	The request was successful and the resource was created.
204 - No content	The request was successful and no additional content was sent.
400 - Bad request	Your request was not valid. It was missing a required parameter or a supplied parameter was invalid.
401 - Unauthorized	No valid API key was provided.
403 - Forbidden	You have reached the rate limit.
404 - Not found	The requested resource does not exist.
422 - Unprocessable entity	Your request is valid but the creation of the resource failed. Check the errors.
429 - Too many requests	You have reached your usage limit. Upgrade your plan if necessary.
451 - Unavailable for legal reasons	We have been requested not to process personal identifiable information linked to this person. Therefore, we cannot proceed with your request.
5XX - Server errors	Something went wrong on Hunter's end.



Error example
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "wrong_params",
      "code": 400,
      "details": "You are missing the domain parameter"
    }
  ]
}
Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Errors

Here are the errors specific to the Email Verifier API call. If you can't find an error in the list, please also check the general API errors.

202	The verification is still in progress. Feel free to make the API call again as often as necessary. It will only count as a single request until we return the response.
222	The verification failed because of an unexpected response from the remote SMTP server. This failure is outside of our control. We recommend to retry later.
400
wrong_params	The email parameter is missing.
400
invalid_email	

The supplied email is invalid.


451
claimed_email	

The person owning the email address asked us directly or indirectly to stop the processing of their personal data. For this reason, you shouldn't process it yourself in any way.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}

industry	The industries you want to select companies by, you can specify a list of industries to include and/or a list to exclude. See industries.json for the list of valid industries.
headcount	The company sizes you want to include in the results. The possible values are 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-10000 or 10001+

The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
keywords	Keywords to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of keywords in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all keywords in the match field (the default value is all).
technology	Technologies to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of technologies in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all technologies in the match field (the default value is all). See technologies.json for the list of valid technologies.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
funding	You can provide a list of funding series in the series field to narrow down your selection of companies. The possible values are pre_seed, seed, pre_series_a, series_a, pre_series_b, series_b, pre_series_c, series_c+ or other

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.

api_key
Required

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Errors

Hunter's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In case of error, the API returns an array of errors containing information regarding what happened.

Error example
{
  "errors": [
    {

      "code": 400,
      "details": "You are missing the domain parameter"
    }
  ]
}
Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.

    ]
  }
}

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.

"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Errors

Here are the errors specific to the Email Verifier API call. If you can't find an error in the list, please also check the general API errors.

202	The verification is still in progress. Feel free to make the API call again as often as necessary. It will only count as a single request until we return the response.
222	The verification failed because of an unexpected response from the remote SMTP server. This failure is outside of our control. We recommend to retry later.
400
wrong_params	The email parameter is missing.
400
invalid_email	

The supplied email is invalid.


451
claimed_email	

The person owning the email address asked us directly or indirectly to stop the processing of their personal data. For this reason, you shouldn't process it yourself in any way.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Finder

This API endpoint finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.

domain
Required*
	The domain name of the company.
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that providing the domain name gives better results as it removes the conversion from the company name. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, the domain name will be used. The company name doesn't need to be in lowercase.
linkedin_handle
Required*
	The handle of the LinkedIn profile for which you to find the email address.
first_name
Required**
	The person's first name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
last_name
Required**
	The person's last name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
full_name
Required**
	The person's full name. Note that you'll get better results by supplying the person's first and last name if you can. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
max_duration	The maximum duration of the request in seconds. Setting a longer duration allows us to refine the results and provide more accurate data. It must range between 3 and 20. The default is 10.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name, the company name, or the LinkedIn handle.

** You must send at least the first name and the last name or the full name (except if using the LinkedIn handle).

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Error example
{
  "errors": [
    {

      "code": 400,
      "details": "You are missing the domain parameter"
    }
  ]
}
Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Europe, Asia, North America, Africa, Antarctica, South America or Oceania

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "headquarters_location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}

industry	The industries you want to select companies by, you can specify a list of industries to include and/or a list to exclude. See industries.json for the list of valid industries.
headcount	The company sizes you want to include in the results. The possible values are 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-10000 or 10001+
company_type	The types of companies you want to select on. You can specify a list of types to include and/or exclude. The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
keywords	Keywords to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of keywords in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all keywords in the match field (the default value is all).
technology	Technologies to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of technologies in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all technologies in the match field (the default value is all). See technologies.json for the list of valid technologies.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
funding	You can provide a list of funding series in the series field to narrow down your selection of companies. The possible values are pre_seed, seed, pre_series_a, series_a, pre_series_b, series_b, pre_series_c, series_c+ or other

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

Email Finder

This API endpoint finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.

domain
Required*
	The domain name of the company.
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that providing the domain name gives better results as it removes the conversion from the company name. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, the domain name will be used. The company name doesn't need to be in lowercase.
linkedin_handle
Required*
	The handle of the LinkedIn profile for which you to find the email address.
first_name
Required**
	The person's first name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
last_name
Required**
	The person's last name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
full_name
Required**
	The person's full name. Note that you'll get better results by supplying the person's first and last name if you can. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
max_duration	The maximum duration of the request in seconds. Setting a longer duration allows us to refine the results and provide more accurate data. It must range between 3 and 20. The default is 10.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name, the company name, or the LinkedIn handle.

** You must send at least the first name and the last name or the full name (except if using the LinkedIn handle).

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Europe, Asia, North America, Africa, Antarctica, South America or Oceania

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "headquarters_location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}

industry	The industries you want to select companies by, you can specify a list of industries to include and/or a list to exclude. See industries.json for the list of valid industries.
headcount	The company sizes you want to include in the results. The possible values are 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-10000 or 10001+
company_type	The types of companies you want to select on. You can specify a list of types to include and/or exclude. The possible values are educational, educational institution, government agency, non profit, partnership, privately held, public company, self employed, self owned or sole proprietorship
year_founded	The years in which the companies were founded, for example "2010". You can specify either multiple years to include and/or exclude or you can specify a range by giving a value for from and/or to.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
keywords	Keywords to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of keywords in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all keywords in the match field (the default value is all).
technology	Technologies to narrow down your selection of companies. You can specify a list of technologies in the include field to select on and/or a list in the exclude field to exclude from the results. You can specify to match on any or all technologies in the match field (the default value is all). See technologies.json for the list of valid technologies.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
funding	You can provide a list of funding series in the series field to narrow down your selection of companies. The possible values are pre_seed, seed, pre_series_a, series_a, pre_series_b, series_b, pre_series_c, series_c+ or other

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.
offset	Specifies the number of domains to skip. The default is 0. You can only change the offset if you are on a Premium plan.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

Required*
	The handle of the LinkedIn profile for which you to find associated information.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}

Introduction

You can enjoy our service's features with our simple JSON API:

Discover returns companies matching a set of criteria.
The Domain Search returns all the email addresses found using one given domain name, with sources.
The Email Finder finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.
The Email Verifier checks the deliverability of a given email address, verifies if it has been found in our database, and returns their sources.
The Enrichment returns all the information we have about a person or a company.

Our API also provides you a RESTful way to manage your Hunter's resources. These are the resources you can Create, Read, Update and Delete with our API:

The Leads
The Custom Attributes
The Leads Lists
The Email Sequences
	
API endpoint
https://api.hunter.io/v2/
Structure

Our API is designed to be as simple to use as possible. We always use the same basic structure:

data contains the data you requested.
meta provides information regarding your request.
errors shows errors with insights regarding what made the request fail. Learn more about the errors responses.
	
Successful response
{
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    ...
  }
}



Error response
{
  "errors": {
    ...
  }
}
Authentication

Authentication is made with a key you will have to add to every call you make to our API. This parameter is always required. We'll return an error if the key is either missing or invalid.

It can be passed in the api_key query parameter, in the X-API-KEY header, or in the Authorization header (Bearer YOUR_API_KEY).

Your API key is what identifies your account, so make sure to keep it secret! You can at anytime retrieve, generate or delete API keys on your dashboard.

A special API key can be used to test our API: test-api-key. It will validate the provided parameters, but will always return the same, dummy, response. It is available on our three main endpoints: the Domain Search, the Email Finder, and the Email Verifier.

Discover

Returns companies matching a set of criteria. This call is free.

Each response will return up to 100 companies. Premium users can use the offset and limit parameters to paginate and get more results.

You can use our other endpoints to get more information about the returned results. For instance, you can find email addresses for the surfaced companies using the Domain Search , or you can get more information about the companies using Company Enrichment.

You can either manually specify the filters for your search using the specific filter parameters, or use natural language with the query parameter to describe the attributes of your target companies, and an AI assistant will select appropriate filters for you.

query	Search query, in your natural language. For example, "Companies in Europe in the Tech Industry".
organization	You can specify a list of domains in the domain field to select on and/or a list of company names in the name field to select on. When you supply both, the API will combine the results into a set of domain names.
similar_to	You can either specify a domain or a name of a company to find similar companies for. If you specify both then the domain will be used.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
headquarters_location	Locations of the headquarters of the companies you want to find. You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

You can also specify a range of funding amounts in the amount field, you can specify a from and/or to value

Finally you can also specify a range of funding dates in the date field, here you can also specify a from and/or to value.

This filter is only available on a Premium plan.
limit	Specifies the max number of domains to return. The default is 100. You can only change the limit if you are on a Premium plan.

api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 domains. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them (this requires a Premium plan).

filters in the meta section returns the filters that were applied based on the input parameters. If you want to paginate the results of the AI assistant, we strongly recommend using these filters instead of natural language on consecutive calls—this will ensure your set of desired filters stays consistent.

The Discover API endpoint is rate limited to 5 requests per second and 50 requests per minute.

* You must send a query or at least one filter.

Domain Search

One key feature of Hunter is to search all the email addresses corresponding to one website. You give one domain name and it returns all the email addresses using this domain name found on the internet.

domain
Required*
	Domain name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe.com".
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that you'll get better results by supplying the domain name as we won't have to find it. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, we'll use the domain name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
limit	Specifies the max number of email addresses to return. The default is 10.
offset	Specifies the number of email addresses to skip. The default is 0.
type	Get only personal or generic email addresses.
seniority	Get only email addresses for people with the selected seniority level. The possible values are junior, senior or executive. Several seniority levels can be selected (delimited by a comma).
department	Get only email addresses for people working in the selected department(s). The possible values are executive, it, finance, management, sales, legal, support, hr, marketing, communication, education, design, health or operations. Several departments can be selected (comma-delimited).
required_field	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected field(s). The possible values are full_name, position and phone_number. Several fields can be selected (comma-delimited).
verification_status	Get only email addresses that have the selected verification status(es). The possible values are valid, accept_all and unknown. Several statuses can be selected (comma-delimited).
location	Get only email addresses for people with the selected location(s). You can specify lists of locations in the include field to select on and/or in the exclude field to exclude.

Each location can have either a continent or business_region or country, state and/or city.

continent can be one of the following: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania or South America

business_region can be one of the following: AMER, EMEA, APAC or LATAM

country must contain a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, for example "US" for the United States.

state must contain a valid US state code, for example "CA" for California. You can only use this field when the country is set to "US".

city must contain a city name, for example "San Francisco". Please note that when a city is provided, a country must also be specified: 
{
  "location": {
    "include": [
      { "city": "Paris", "country": "FR" }
    ]
  }
}
 Please note that using this filter requires to use a POST request.
job_titles	Get only email addresses for people that have the selected job title(s). Several job titles can be selected (comma-delimited).
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

Each response will return up to 100 emails. Use the "offset" parameter to get all of them. A new query is counted for calls returning at least one result.

The number of sources is limited to 20 for each email address. The extracted_on attribute of a source contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

type returns the value "personal" or "generic". A "generic" email address is a role-based email address, like contact@hunter.io. On the contrary, a "personal" email address is the address of someone in the company.

confidence is our estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct. It depends on several criteria such as the number and quality of sources.

The Domain Search API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name or the company name. You can also send both.

Email Finder

This API endpoint finds the most likely email address from a domain name, a first name and a last name.

domain
Required*
	The domain name of the company.
company
Required*
	The company name from which you want to find the email addresses. For example, "stripe". Note that providing the domain name gives better results as it removes the conversion from the company name. If you send a request with both the domain and the company name, the domain name will be used. The company name doesn't need to be in lowercase.
linkedin_handle
Required*
	The handle of the LinkedIn profile for which you to find the email address.
first_name
Required**
	The person's first name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
last_name
Required**
	The person's last name. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
full_name
Required**
	The person's full name. Note that you'll get better results by supplying the person's first and last name if you can. It doesn't need to be in lowercase.
max_duration	The maximum duration of the request in seconds. Setting a longer duration allows us to refine the results and provide more accurate data. It must range between 3 and 20. The default is 10.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

If a verification could be run recently on the email address, the related information is displayed in verification. The possible statuses are valid, accept_all, and unknown.

The score is an estimation of the probability the email address returned is correct.

If the email address can be found publicly on the web, the URLs are returned in sources. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time. The number of sources that can be returned is limited to 20.

The Email Finder API endpoint is rate limited to 15 requests per second and 500 requests per minute.

* You must send at least the domain name, the company name, or the LinkedIn handle.

** You must send at least the first name and the last name or the full name (except if using the LinkedIn handle).

Email Verifier

This API endpoint allows you to verify the deliverability of an email address.

The request will run for 20 seconds. If it was not able to provide a response in time, we will return a 202 status code. You will then be able to poll the same endpoint to get the verification's result. Of course, all the requests in this case are counted only once.

email
Required
	The email address you want to verify.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

status returns the status of the email address. It takes 1 out of 6 possible values:

"valid": the email address is valid.
"invalid": the email address is not valid.
"accept_all": the email address is valid but any email address is accepted by the server.
"webmail": the email address comes from an email service provider such as Gmail or Outlook.
"disposable": the email address comes from a disposable email service provider.
"unknown": we failed to verify the email address.

result returns the main status of the verification. It takes 1 out of 3 possible values:

"deliverable": the email verification is successful and the email address is valid.
"undeliverable": the email address is not valid.
"risky": the verification can't be validated.

It is deprecated; use status instead to get the detailed status of the email address.

score is the deliverability score we give to the email address. For webmail and disposable emails, we provide an arbitrary score of 50.

regexp is true if the email address passes our regular expression.

gibberish is true if we find this is an automatically generated email address (for example "e65rc109q@company.com").

disposable is true if we find this is an email address from a disposable email service.

webmail is true if we find this is an email from a webmail (for example Gmail).

mx_records is true if we find MX records exist on the domain of the given email address.

smtp_server is true if we connect to the SMTP server successfully.

smtp_check is true if the email address doesn't bounce.

accept_all is true if the SMTP server accepts all the email addresses. It means you can have have false positives on SMTP checks.

block is true if the SMTP server prevented us to perform the SMTP check.

sources If we have found the given email address somewhere on the web, we display the sources here. The number of sources is limited to 20. The extracted_on attribute contains the date it was found for the first time, whereas the last_seen_on attribute contains the date it was found for the last time.

The Email Verifier API endpoint is rate limited to 10 requests per second and 300 requests per minute.

Add a recipient

Add a recipient to a sequence. The parameters must be passed as a JSON hash.

As the recipient is added, we try to associate it with one of your leads with the same email, or create a new lead in your current list if there's no match. This enables you to send personalized emails by using attributes.

The response contains the skipped_recipients array with emails that were not added to the sequence with the corresponding reason. The %code reason can be one of:

duplicate - email is already added to the sequence
invalid - email has invalid format
removed - email was already removed from the sequence
bounced - previous email sent to this recipient bounced
unsubscribed - recipient unsubscribed from your emails
claimed - recipient decided not to receive any emails

Note that when adding a recipient to an active sequence, the email might be sent shortly after your API call, leaving you no time to cancel the sending in case of a mistake.

id
Required
	Identifier of the sequence
emails
Required*
	The recipients you want to add to the sequence. If there's only one email, it can be supplied as a string. Otherwise, it should be an array of up to 50 emails.
In case an email doesn't pass our validation, an error is returned, and no recipient is added.
lead_ids
Required*
	The lead IDs you want to add to the sequence. It should be an array of up to 50 lead IDs.
In case a lead cannot be found, an error is returned, and no recipients are added.
api_key
Required
	Your secret API key. You can retrieve it in your dashboard.

* You must send at least the email(s), lead ID(s) or both.

API wrappers

These wrappers can help you get started faster with Hunter's API.

They have been built by the community. You can contribute to the projects or contact us to have a new wrapper listed.

Ruby
Node.js
Python
Laravel
Go
R

You can also integrate Hunter's API in your workflow without writing a line of code with Hunter's Zapier integration.

	
Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Our remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides integration between our API and any LLM that supports the MCP protocol (e.g., OpenAI's Responses API or Claude for Desktop), allowing you to interact with the Hunter B2B data using natural language.

The Hunter MCP server is available at https://mcp.hunter.io:

Use https://mcp.hunter.io/sse for Server-Sent Events transport
Use https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp for Streamable HTTP transport (recommended — Use this for OpenAI's Responses API)

Note that using our MCP server requires a valid Hunter API key, which can be provided in the request headers using one of:

The Authorization header with the format Bearer HUNTER_API_KEY
The X-API-KEY header with the value of your Hunter API key

	
Example of using our MCP server with OpenAI's Responses API:
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "hunter-remote-mcp",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.hunter.io/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY" }
      }
    ],
    "input": "YOUR_INPUT"
  }'

For Claude Desktop, you can use the following MCP server configuration:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hunter-remote-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.hunter.io/sse",
        "--header",
        "X-API-KEY:YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}
